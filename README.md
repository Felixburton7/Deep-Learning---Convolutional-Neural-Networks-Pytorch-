## Deep Learning / Convolutional Neural Networks (PyTorch)
This project focuses on implementing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using PyTorch for image classification tasks. Below is a detailed explanation of the various components and steps involved in this project.

# Dataset Preparation
The first step is to download and preprocess the dataset using PyTorch. In this project, we use the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 50,000 training images and 10,000 validation images. Each image is 32x32 pixels with three color channels (RGB).

Data Loading and Transformation
We transform the dataset into tensors and normalize them so all the pixels have a mean of 0.5 and a standard deviation of 0.5. This normalization helps in speeding up the convergence of the network.

# python
Copy code
transform = transforms.Compose(
    [transforms.ToTensor(),
     transforms.Normalize((0.5, 0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 0.5, 0.5))])

trainset = datasets.CIFAR10(root='./data', train=True, download=True, transform=transform)
valset = datasets.CIFAR10(root='./data', train=False, download=True, transform=transform)

train_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(trainset, batch_size=BATCH_SIZE, shuffle=True, num_workers=2)
val_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(valset, batch_size=BATCH_SIZE, shuffle=False, num_workers=2)
Optional: Using Sample Data
For development purposes, you can work with a subset of the data to speed up the training process. Make sure to use the full dataset before final submission.

# python
Copy code
if SAMPLE_DATA:
    trainset, _ = torch.utils.data.random_split(trainset, [BATCH_SIZE * 10, len(trainset) - BATCH_SIZE * 10])
    valset, _ = torch.utils.data.random_split(valset, [BATCH_SIZE * 10, len(valset) - BATCH_SIZE * 10])
Model Training
Helper Functions
We define helper functions to train the model and visualize the results. The train function trains the network, while the accuracy function evaluates the model's performance on the dataset.
